This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It often happens when fetching data from an API or when dealing with asynchronous operations where the data might not be available yet.

```javascript
// Example: Accessing a property of a null object
const myObject = null;
console.log(myObject.property); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'property')

// Example: Accessing a property of an undefined object
let myObject;
console.log(myObject.property); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')
```
