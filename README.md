# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')`. This error typically arises when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently `null` or `undefined`.  This often occurs during asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, where the data may not be immediately available.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The key issue is trying to access the `.property` of an object before it has been assigned a value or has finished loading the data, resulting in the error.
